    "The goal of $k$-means clustering is to be able to perform a form of unsupervised learning, namely classifying data that has not yet been labeled with output values $y$ even though input features $x$ are available. For this kind of work, it will be easier to test our approaches if we can synthesize data sets with known results, to test our code."
